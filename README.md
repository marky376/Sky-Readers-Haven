# Sky Readers Haven

## Project Overview

Sky Readers Haven is an online bookstore. This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict various aspects of the system.

## Architecture

The architecture of Sky Readers Haven is designed to be modular and scalable, utilizing a microservices approach to handle different functionalities independently.

### Overview Diagram

*(Include a high-level diagram here depicting the components and their interactions.)*

- **Frontend:** React.js for building the user interface.
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework for developing APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Cloud:** AWS for deployment and scalability.

### Component Breakdown

- **Frontend:** Handles user interaction and displays data fetched from the backend.
- **Backend:** Processes requests, interacts with the database, and serves responses through APIs.
- **Database:** Stores user data, book information, and transaction records.
- **Cloud Services:** Hosts the application, provides storage solutions, and manages load balancing.

## APIs and Methods

Sky Readers Haven utilizes RESTful APIs to communicate between the frontend and backend. Below are some of the key endpoints:

### Authentication

- **POST /api/auth/register:** Registers a new user.
  - Request: `{ "username": "string", "password": "string", "email": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "message": "User registered successfully." }`

- **POST /api/auth/login:** Authenticates a user and returns a token.
  - Request: `{ "username": "string", "password": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "token": "jwt-token" }`

### Book Catalog

- **GET /api/books:** Retrieves a list of all books.
  - Response: `[ { "id": "int", "title": "string", "author": "string", "price": "float" }, ... ]`

- **GET /api/books/{id}:** Retrieves details of a specific book.
  - Response: `{ "id": "int", "title": "string", "author": "string", "price": "float", "description": "string" }`

### Shopping Cart

- **POST /api/cart:** Adds a book to the cart.
  - Request: `{ "book_id": "int", "quantity": "int" }`
  - Response: `{ "message": "Book added to cart." }`

- **GET /api/cart:** Retrieves the current user's cart.
  - Response: `[ { "book_id": "int", "title": "string", "quantity": "int", "price": "float" }, ... ]`

### Orders

- **POST /api/orders:** Creates a new order from the cart.
  - Request: `{ "cart_id": "int", "payment_method": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "message": "Order placed successfully." }`

## Data Modeling

Data in Sky Readers Haven is structured and managed using PostgreSQL. Below are the primary tables and their relationships:

### User Table

- `id`: Primary Key
- `username`: String
- `password`: String (hashed)
- `email`: String

### Book Table

- `id`: Primary Key
- `title`: String
- `author`: String
- `price`: Float
- `description`: Text

### Cart Table

- `id`: Primary Key
- `user_id`: Foreign Key (references User)
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### CartItem Table

- `id`: Primary Key
- `cart_id`: Foreign Key (references Cart)
- `book_id`: Foreign Key (references Book)
- `quantity`: Integer

### Order Table

- `id`: Primary Key
- `user_id`: Foreign Key (references User)
- `total_amount`: Float
- `status`: String
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to register and create an account so that I can log in and make purchases.**
2. **As a user, I want to browse books by category so that I can find books I like.**
3. **As a user, I want to add books to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them later.**
4. **As a user, I want to place an order for the books in my cart so that I can buy them.**
5. **As an admin, I want to add and manage book listings so that users can see the available books.**

## Mockups

*(Include mockups here. You can use tools like Figma or Sketch to create visual representations of the pages, such as the homepage, book detail page, cart, and checkout process.)*

## Cloud Services

We are considering using Microsoft Azure or AWS Cloud for the project.

### AWS

- **EC2:** For hosting the backend server.
- **S3:** For storing static assets like book images.
- **RDS:** For managing the PostgreSQL database.
- **CloudFront:** For CDN to speed up content delivery.

### Azure

- **Azure App Service:** For hosting the backend server.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** For storing static assets.
- **Azure SQL Database:** For managing the PostgreSQL database.
- **Azure CDN:** For content delivery.
